                <p>Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses 
                decide which class to instantiate. Factory method lets a class defer
                instantiate to subclasses</p>

                <p>A class can't anticipate the class of objects it must create</p>
                <p>A class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates</p>
                <p>Classes delegate responsibility to one of several helper subclasses
                and you want to localize the knowledge of which helper subclass is
                the delegate</p>
