    <div>
        The singleton pattern can be implemented by creating a class with 
        a method that create a new instance of the classs if one doesn't
        exit.In the event of an instance already exists, it simply returns
        a reference to that object.
        With Javascript, singleton serve as a namespace provider which isolate
        implementation code from the global namespace so-as to provide a single
        point of access for functions.
        The singleton doesn't provide a way for code that doesn't know a previous
        reference to the singleton to easily retrive it - it is not the object
        or 'class' that's returned by a singleton, it's a structure.
