                <p>You want to provide a single interface to a complex subsystem.
                    Subsystems ofent get more complex as they evolve</p>
                <p>there are many dependences between clients and the implementation
                classes of an abstraction</p>
                <p>You want to layer your subsystems.If subsystems are dependent
                the you are  simplify the dependences between them by making them
                comunicate with each other solely through their facades</p>

                <p>Do work of its own to translate its interface to subsystem interfaces
