                <p>The key to this pattern is an abstract command class, which
                    declares an interface for executing opereation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Implementation wise, simple command objects bind together both an 
                    action.They consistently include an execution operation.All Command
                    objects with the same interface can easily be swapped as needed and
                    this is considered of the larger benefits of the pattern.
